<h2>Peridot</h2>

Written in C#, Peridot provides bindings between Ruby and <a href="https://github.com/Marin-MK/odl">odl</a> using <a href="https://github.com/Marin-MK/rubydotnet">rubydotnet</a>. This gives Ruby the opportunity to display and manage graphics with C#, thereby also allowing C# to communicate with Ruby.
